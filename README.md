Mech Mayhem is a game that simulates one-on-one fights of battle robots. The player first designs a robot from three sets of parts, each combination offering a slightly different playstyle. Then, they are thrown into a stadium against an AI opponent, viewing the fight from a top-down perspective. During the fight, the player controls their robot by changing its aggression or triggering its superpower. If the player wins their fight, they may pick one of three upgrades, improving their robot's health, damage, or speed. The player is thrown into another fight against a stronger opponent. This cycle continues until the player is defeated.
